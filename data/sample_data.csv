Refugee camps in eastern Chad house about 300,000 people who fled violence in the Darfur region of Sudan.



The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said on Monday that more than 12,000 people have fled militia attacks over the last few days from Sudan's Darfur region to neighboring Chad, still recovering from a recent attempt by rebels there to topple the government.



""Most of the new arrivals in Chad had already been displaced in Darfur in recent years. They are really tired of being attacked and having to move,"" said UNHCR's Jorge Holly. ""All the new refugees we talked to said they did not want to go back to Darfur at this point, they wanted to be transferred to a refugee camp in eastern Chad.""



This latest influx of refugees in Chad aggravates an already deteriorating security situation across this politically unstable region of Africa.



Before the latest flight into Chad, the UNHCR and its partner groups ""were taking care of 240,000 Sudanese refugees in 12 camps in eastern Chad and some 50,000 from Central African Republic in the south of the country."" Up to 30,000 people in Chad fled the country for Cameroon during the rebel-government fighting.



The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Monday that one of its employees was killed in western Darfur last week during fighting. The victim is a 45-year-old Sudanese national and father of six children.



He was killed in the area of Seleia, one of the three towns where reported government-backed Janjaweed militia attacks on Friday left around 200 people dead.



U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week deplored the acts, urged all parties to stop hostilities, and said ""all parties must adhere to international humanitarian law, which prohibits military attacks against civilians.""



The United Nations says ""more than 200,000 people have been killed and 2.2 million others forced to flee their homes since fighting began in 2003 among government forces, rebel groups and allied militia groups known as the Janjaweed.""

Refugee camps in eastern Chad house about 300,000 people who fled violence in the Darfur region of Sudan.



The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said on Monday that more than 12,000 people have fled militia attacks over the last few days from Sudan's Darfur region to neighboring Chad, still recovering from a recent attempt by rebels there to topple the government.



""Most of the new arrivals in Chad had already been displaced in Darfur in recent years. They are really tired of being attacked and having to move,"" said UNHCR's Jorge Holly. ""All the new refugees we talked to said they did not want to go back to Darfur at this point, they wanted to be transferred to a refugee camp in eastern Chad.""



This latest influx of refugees in Chad aggravates an already deteriorating security situation across this politically unstable region of Africa.



Before the latest flight into Chad, the UNHCR and its partner groups ""were taking care of 240,000 Sudanese refugees in 12 camps in eastern Chad and some 50,000 from Central African Republic in the south of the country."" Up to 30,000 people in Chad fled the country for Cameroon during the rebel-government fighting.



The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Monday that one of its employees was killed in western Darfur last week during fighting. The victim is a 45-year-old Sudanese national and father of six children.



He was killed in the area of Seleia, one of the three towns where reported government-backed Janjaweed militia attacks on Friday left around 200 people dead.



U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week deplored the acts, urged all parties to stop hostilities, and said ""all parties must adhere to international humanitarian law, which prohibits military attacks against civilians.""



The United Nations says ""more than 200,000 people have been killed and 2.2 million others forced to flee their homes since fighting began in 2003 among government forces, rebel groups and allied militia groups known as the Janjaweed.""

""When we used to apply for passports under the apartheid government, we never knew until the last moment what their decision was,"" Tutu said at a news conference. ""Our government is worse than the apartheid government because at least you were expecting it from the apartheid government.





""I have to say that I can't believe this. I really can't believe this,"" Tutu said. ""You have to wake me up and tell me this is actually happening here.""





The Dalai Lama scrapped his planned trip to South Africa this week after the nation failed to issue him a visa in time, his spokesman said.





Visa applications for him and his entourage were submitted to the South African High Commission in New Delhi, India, at the end of August, and original passports were submitted on September 20, more than two weeks ago, a statement on his website said.





However, South Africa's foreign affairs office said it did not refuse a visa.





""South Africa will not comment on the decision, because it is not our decision, it is his decision,"" according to spokesman Clayson Monyela, who said the visa application was still under consideration.





The Dalai Lama had been invited to the country to receive the Mahatma Gandhi International Award for Peace and Reconciliation and to speak at a number of events, including a lecture in honor of Tutu's 80th birthday. Tutu and the Dalai Lama are recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize.





Tutu said he would pray for the defeat of South Africa's government, led by the African National Congress (ANC), which is rooted in the fight against the system of apartheid, or legal racial separation, that was present in South Africa until 1994.





""You are disgraceful,"" Tutu said about the government. ""You are behaving in a way that is totally at variance with the things for which we stood.""





The ANC plans to call on government officials to explain to South Africans why the visa process was delayed, spokesman Jackson Mtembu said. He said everyone was in the dark about this matter.





But he also suggested that Tutu calm down. A comparison to apartheid regimes, he said, was unfair.





This is not the first time the Dalai Lama has not been able to visit South Africa. In 2009, South Africa refused the Tibetan spiritual leader a visa to attend an international peace conference, saying it was not in the country's interest for him to attend.





In refusing the 2009 application, South Africa said that if the Dalai Lama attended the conference, the focus would shift away from the 2010 World Cup, the global soccer championship it was hosting.





""We cannot allow focus to shift to China and Tibet,"" presidential spokesman Thabo Masebe said, adding that South Africa had gained much from its trading relationship with China.





The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, and China pressures governments around the world to deny him any legitimacy.





Speculation surfaced Tuesday that this year's visit was also affected by South Africa's relationship with China.





South African Vice President Kgalema Motlanthe visited Beijing last week and met with Chinese President Hu Jintao to discuss bolstering bilateral ties.





Motlanthe said South Africa was ready to boost the strategic partnership between the two countries to a new stage, according to the official Chinese news agency Xinhua.





But Monyela said the application had nothing to do with China.





""We are a sovereign nation which takes decisions in our domestic interest,"" Monyela said.

Motlanthe said South Africa was ready to boost the strategic partnership between the two countries to a new stage, according to the official Chinese news agency Xinhua.





But Monyela said the application had nothing to do with China.





""We are a sovereign nation which takes decisions in our domestic interest,"" Monyela said.





The Dalai Lama posted a message on Twitter last week that said: ""Even if the Chinese leave nothing but ashes, Tibet will rise from these ashes as a free country even if it takes a long time to do so.""

./cnn/stories/c65ed85800e4535f4bbbfa2c34d7d9630358d303.story,Who was denied visa to South Africa in 2009?,"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Miffed by a visa delay that led the Dalai Lama to cancel a trip to South Africa, Archbishop Desmond Tutu lashed out at his government Tuesday, saying it had acted worse than apartheid regimes and had forgotten all that the nation stood for.





""When we used to apply for passports under the apartheid government, we never knew until the last moment what their decision was,"" Tutu said at a news conference. ""Our government is worse than the apartheid government because at least you were expecting it from the apartheid government.





""I have to say that I can't believe this. I really can't believe this,"" Tutu said. ""You have to wake me up and tell me this is actually happening here.""





The Dalai Lama scrapped his planned trip to South Africa this week after the nation failed to issue him a visa in time, his spokesman said.





Visa applications for him and his entourage were submitted to the South African High Commission in New Delhi, India, at the end of August, and original passports were submitted on September 20, more than two weeks ago, a statement on his website said.





However, South Africa's foreign affairs office said it did not refuse a visa.





""South Africa will not comment on the decision, because it is not our decision, it is his decision,"" according to spokesman Clayson Monyela, who said the visa application was still under consideration.





The Dalai Lama had been invited to the country to receive the Mahatma Gandhi International Award for Peace and Reconciliation and to speak at a number of events, including a lecture in honor of Tutu's 80th birthday. Tutu and the Dalai Lama are recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize.





Tutu said he would pray for the defeat of South Africa's government, led by the African National Congress (ANC), which is rooted in the fight against the system of apartheid, or legal racial separation, that was present in South Africa until 1994.





""You are disgraceful,"" Tutu said about the government. ""You are behaving in a way that is totally at variance with the things for which we stood.""





The ANC plans to call on government officials to explain to South Africans why the visa process was delayed, spokesman Jackson Mtembu said. He said everyone was in the dark about this matter.





But he also suggested that Tutu calm down. A comparison to apartheid regimes, he said, was unfair.





This is not the first time the Dalai Lama has not been able to visit South Africa. In 2009, South Africa refused the Tibetan spiritual leader a visa to attend an international peace conference, saying it was not in the country's interest for him to attend.





In refusing the 2009 application, South Africa said that if the Dalai Lama attended the conference, the focus would shift away from the 2010 World Cup, the global soccer championship it was hosting.





""We cannot allow focus to shift to China and Tibet,"" presidential spokesman Thabo Masebe said, adding that South Africa had gained much from its trading relationship with China.





The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, and China pressures governments around the world to deny him any legitimacy.





Speculation surfaced Tuesday that this year's visit was also affected by South Africa's relationship with China.





South African Vice President Kgalema Motlanthe visited Beijing last week and met with Chinese President Hu Jintao to discuss bolstering bilateral ties.

England international Steven Gerrard was cleared by a court in Liverpool of affray.



The jury at Liverpool Crown Court took a little over an hour to clear Gerrard of charges relating to a fracas in a nightclub bar in the north-western of England city on December 29 of last year.



They accepted the Liverpool captain's version that he acted in self defense in punching businessman Marcus McGhee.



The 29-year-old was the only one of the seven defendants in the case to be cleared after an incident which was described by judge Henry Globe as an ""explosion of violence.""



Gerrard spoke of his relief outside the court.

""I'm glad to put this case behind me and I am really looking forward to the season ahead and concentrating on my football now.



""I would just like to say a big thank you to my legal team and to my friends and family and everyone at Liverpool football club for supporting me.""



His comments were met with a round of applause from a large group of fans of the Premier League club who had gathered outside the court, before he was ushered away.



Gerrard was celebrating in the Lounge Inn in Southport, a suburb of Liverpool, after scoring twice his team's 5-1 win at Newcastle which took them to the top of the Premier League.



Video footage, which was available to the court, showed the moment around 2.am in the morning when trouble flared.



Gerrard apparently wanted to change the music on the CD player and the 34-year-old McGee said the football star had acted aggressively in trying to grab the device.

In response to the recent attacks on Christians, authorities have ordered more checkpoints in several of the city's Christian neighborhoods.



The attacks may have been prompted by Christian demonstrations ahead of provincial elections, which are to be held by January 31, authorities said.



Hundreds of Christians took to the streets in Mosul and surrounding villages and towns, demanding adequate representation on provincial councils, whose members will be chosen in the local elections.



Thursday, Iraq's minister of immigration and displaced persons discussed building housing complexes for Christian families in northern Iraq and allocating land to build the complexes.

./cnn/stories/13012604e3203c18df09289dfedd14cde67cf40b.story,What were the families ordered to do?,"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- At least 6,000 Christians have fled the northern Iraqi city of Mosul in the past week because of killings and death threats, Iraq's Ministry of Immigration and Displaced Persons said Thursday.



A Christian family that fled Mosul found refuge in the Al-Sayida monastery about 30 miles north of the city.



The number represents 1,424 families, at least 70 more families than were reported to be displaced on Wednesday.



The ministry said it had set up an operation room to follow up sending urgent aid to the displaced Christian families as a result of attacks by what it called ""terrorist groups.""



Iraqi officials have said the families were frightened by a series of killings and threats by Muslim extremists ordering them to convert to Islam or face death.



Fourteen Christians have been slain in the past two weeks in the city, which is about 260 miles (420 kilometers) north of Baghdad.



Mosul is one of the last Iraqi cities where al Qaeda in Iraq has a significant presence and routinely carries out attacks. The U.S. military said it killed the Sunni militant group's No. 2 leader, Abu Qaswarah, in a raid in the northern city earlier this month.



In response to the recent attacks on Christians, authorities have ordered more checkpoints in several of the city's Christian neighborhoods.



The attacks may have been prompted by Christian demonstrations ahead of provincial elections, which are to be held by January 31, authorities said.



Hundreds of Christians took to the streets in Mosul and surrounding villages and towns, demanding adequate representation on provincial councils, whose members will be chosen in the local elections.



Thursday, Iraq's minister of immigration and displaced persons discussed building housing complexes for Christian families in northern Iraq and allocating land to build the complexes.



Abdel Samad Rahman Sultan brought up the issue when he met with a representative of Iraq's Hammurabi Organization for Human Rights and with the head of the Kojina Organization for helping displaced persons.

The late pope had a particular belt for self-flagellation and brought it with him to his summer residence, according to the book, ""Why he is a Saint: The True story of John Paul II.""





""As some members of his own entourage were able to hear with their own ears, both in Poland and in the Vatican, Karol Wojtyla flagellated himself,"" the book says, using the name the pope was given at birth.





""In the closet, among the cloaks, a particular pant-belt hung from a hook, which he utilized as a whip and one which he always had brought to Castel Gandolfo,"" the book says.





The book was written by a Vatican insider, Slawomir Oder, with Italian journalist Saverio Gaeta of the Catholic weekly Christian Family. Oder is head of the Vatican committee investigating whether John Paul II should be declared a saint. John Paul died in 2005.





The evil albino monk in Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" may be the best-known example of self-flagellation these days, but the practice is not unusual in Catholicism -- or nearly as extreme as it is shown in the movie.





""When members or former members [of Opus Dei] see the monk go at it in the movie, they just burst out laughing, it's so nutty,"" said the Rev. Michael Barrett, a priest of the Catholic Opus Dei sect.





In actual Catholic self-flagellation, ""there is no blood, no injury, nothing to harm a person's health, nothing traumatic. If it caused any harm, the Church would not allow it,"" he wrote on Opus Dei's Web site when the movie came out in 2006.





""This voluntarily accepted discomfort is a way of joining oneself to Jesus Christ and the sufferings he voluntarily accepted in order to redeem us from sin. 'The Da Vinci Code's' masochist monk, who loves pain for its own sake, has nothing to do with real Christian mortification,"" Barrett said.





Mother Teresa is among famous Catholics who self-flagellated in some way, Barrett said.





Catholics are not alone in choosing to inflict pain on themselves for religion reasons. Some Shiite Muslims lash themselves until they bleed when marking the mourning period of Ashura, while fasting is practiced by people in several religions, including Jews on Yom Kippur, the day of atonement.





David Gibson, a journalist who worked for Vatican Radio when John Paul II was pope, pointed out that the pontiff wrote an apostolic letter -- essentially a papal position paper -- on suffering in 1984.





""Christ did not conceal from his listeners the need for suffering. He said very clearly: 'If any man would come after me ... let him take up his cross daily,' "" the pope wrote, quoting the Gospel of Luke.





Jesus, the pope wrote, ""suffered in place of man and for man. Every man has his own share in the Redemption. Each one is also called to share in that suffering through which the Redemption was accomplished.





""In bringing about the Redemption through suffering, Christ has also raised human suffering to the level of the Redemption. Thus each man, in his suffering, can also become a sharer in the redemptive suffering of Christ,"" says the letter, Salvifici Doloris, On the Christian Meaning of Human Suffering.





""John Paul was a product of a very Old World Polish Catholicism,"" said Gibson, who now writes on religion for Politics Daily.





""He was a very disciplined man and a very rigorous man in his personal spirituality,"" he said.





The authors of the new book clearly approve of any whipping the pope did of himself, he added.





""Even though it's going to weird people out, it's obviously seen by his postulators as a sign of his holiness,"" he said, using the technical term for the person who investigates a person's qualifications for sainthood.





He said the idea is not as bizarre as it might sound to contemporary ears.





""The idea of fasting, renouncing something, giving up your Starbucks latte so you can send money to Haiti -- you can't simply look down your nose at it without rejecting a lot of other ideas about self-sacrifice,"" he said.

The late pope had a particular belt for self-flagellation and brought it with him to his summer residence, according to the book, ""Why he is a Saint: The True story of John Paul II.""





""As some members of his own entourage were able to hear with their own ears, both in Poland and in the Vatican, Karol Wojtyla flagellated himself,"" the book says, using the name the pope was given at birth.





""In the closet, among the cloaks, a particular pant-belt hung from a hook, which he utilized as a whip and one which he always had brought to Castel Gandolfo,"" the book says.





The book was written by a Vatican insider, Slawomir Oder, with Italian journalist Saverio Gaeta of the Catholic weekly Christian Family. Oder is head of the Vatican committee investigating whether John Paul II should be declared a saint. John Paul died in 2005.





The evil albino monk in Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" may be the best-known example of self-flagellation these days, but the practice is not unusual in Catholicism -- or nearly as extreme as it is shown in the movie.





""When members or former members [of Opus Dei] see the monk go at it in the movie, they just burst out laughing, it's so nutty,"" said the Rev. Michael Barrett, a priest of the Catholic Opus Dei sect.





In actual Catholic self-flagellation, ""there is no blood, no injury, nothing to harm a person's health, nothing traumatic. If it caused any harm, the Church would not allow it,"" he wrote on Opus Dei's Web site when the movie came out in 2006.





""This voluntarily accepted discomfort is a way of joining oneself to Jesus Christ and the sufferings he voluntarily accepted in order to redeem us from sin. 'The Da Vinci Code's' masochist monk, who loves pain for its own sake, has nothing to do with real Christian mortification,"" Barrett said.





Mother Teresa is among famous Catholics who self-flagellated in some way, Barrett said.





Catholics are not alone in choosing to inflict pain on themselves for religion reasons. Some Shiite Muslims lash themselves until they bleed when marking the mourning period of Ashura, while fasting is practiced by people in several religions, including Jews on Yom Kippur, the day of atonement.





David Gibson, a journalist who worked for Vatican Radio when John Paul II was pope, pointed out that the pontiff wrote an apostolic letter -- essentially a papal position paper -- on suffering in 1984.





""Christ did not conceal from his listeners the need for suffering. He said very clearly: 'If any man would come after me ... let him take up his cross daily,' "" the pope wrote, quoting the Gospel of Luke.





Jesus, the pope wrote, ""suffered in place of man and for man. Every man has his own share in the Redemption. Each one is also called to share in that suffering through which the Redemption was accomplished.





""In bringing about the Redemption through suffering, Christ has also raised human suffering to the level of the Redemption. Thus each man, in his suffering, can also become a sharer in the redemptive suffering of Christ,"" says the letter, Salvifici Doloris, On the Christian Meaning of Human Suffering.





""John Paul was a product of a very Old World Polish Catholicism,"" said Gibson, who now writes on religion for Politics Daily.





""He was a very disciplined man and a very rigorous man in his personal spirituality,"" he said.





The authors of the new book clearly approve of any whipping the pope did of himself, he added.





""Even though it's going to weird people out, it's obviously seen by his postulators as a sign of his holiness,"" he said, using the technical term for the person who investigates a person's qualifications for sainthood.

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has outlined where he thinks U.S. policy needs to change.

Ali Larijani said Saturday that Obama should apply his campaign message of change to U.S. dealings with Iran.

""Obama must know that the change that he talks about is not simply a superficial changing of colors or tactics,"" Larijani said in comments carried by the semi-official Mehr News Agency.

""What is expected is a change in strategy, not the repetition of objections to Iran's nuclear program, which will be taking a step in the wrong direction.""

In his first post-election news conference Friday afternoon, Obama reiterated that he believes a nuclear-armed Iran would be ""unacceptable."" He also said he would help mount an international effort to prevent it from happening.

Larijani said that U.S. behavior toward Iran ""will not change so simply"" but that Obama's election showed internal conditions in the United States have shifted.

He added that Iran does not mind if the United States provides other Persian Gulf countries with nuclear technology, but ""you should know that you cannot prevent the Islamic Republic [from reaching its goals in the nuclear field],"" according to the news agency.

Obama cautioned Friday that it had only been a few days since the election and that he was not in office.

""Obviously, how we approach and deal with a country like Iran is not something that we should simply do in a knee-jerk fashion. I think we've got to think it through,"" Obama said.

""But I have to reiterate once again that we only have one president at a time. And I want to be very careful that we are sending the right signals to the world as a whole that I am not the president, and I won't be until January 20th.""

Larijani was speaking two days after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad congratulated Obama, the first time an Iranian leader has offered such wishes to a U.S. president-elect since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

One analyst said the welcome was a gesture from the hard-line president that he is open to a more conciliatory relationship with the United States.

Ahmadinejad said Tehran ""welcomes basic and fair changes in U.S. policies and conducts,"" according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency on Thursday.

Relations between the United States and Iran have historically been chilly and have been further strained in recent years over Iran's nuclear program.

Tehran insists that the program exists for peaceful purposes, but the United States and other Western nations are concerned by Iran's refusal to halt uranium enrichment activities.

./cnn/stories/d191e20468fc7675fcfa55c33fab1e65405740a0.story,US - Iran tensions are high over what?,"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's parliament speaker has criticized U.S. President-elect Barack Obama for saying that Iran's development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable.

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has outlined where he thinks U.S. policy needs to change.

Ali Larijani said Saturday that Obama should apply his campaign message of change to U.S. dealings with Iran.

""Obama must know that the change that he talks about is not simply a superficial changing of colors or tactics,"" Larijani said in comments carried by the semi-official Mehr News Agency.

""What is expected is a change in strategy, not the repetition of objections to Iran's nuclear program, which will be taking a step in the wrong direction.""

In his first post-election news conference Friday afternoon, Obama reiterated that he believes a nuclear-armed Iran would be ""unacceptable."" He also said he would help mount an international effort to prevent it from happening.

Larijani said that U.S. behavior toward Iran ""will not change so simply"" but that Obama's election showed internal conditions in the United States have shifted.

He added that Iran does not mind if the United States provides other Persian Gulf countries with nuclear technology, but ""you should know that you cannot prevent the Islamic Republic [from reaching its goals in the nuclear field],"" according to the news agency.

Obama cautioned Friday that it had only been a few days since the election and that he was not in office.

""Obviously, how we approach and deal with a country like Iran is not something that we should simply do in a knee-jerk fashion. I think we've got to think it through,"" Obama said.

""But I have to reiterate once again that we only have one president at a time. And I want to be very careful that we are sending the right signals to the world as a whole that I am not the president, and I won't be until January 20th.""

Larijani was speaking two days after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad congratulated Obama, the first time an Iranian leader has offered such wishes to a U.S. president-elect since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

One analyst said the welcome was a gesture from the hard-line president that he is open to a more conciliatory relationship with the United States.

Ahmadinejad said Tehran ""welcomes basic and fair changes in U.S. policies and conducts,"" according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency on Thursday.

Relations between the United States and Iran have historically been chilly and have been further strained in recent years over Iran's nuclear program.

Radu Mazare, the mayor of the town of Constanta, wore a Nazi uniform during a fashion show over the weekend.





Radu Mazare, the mayor of the town of Constanta, and his 15-year-old son ""entered the stage marching the clearly identifiable Nazi 'goose step,'"" the Center for Monitoring and Combating anti-Semitism in Romania said in a letter to the country's prosecutor general.





The organization's director, Marco Katz, said Mazare had broken Romanian law and encouraged his son to do the same, ""educating him to treat the law with contempt.""





Katz said Mazare was sending a message ""that to wear Nazi uniforms and to march the Nazi steps is legal and 'in vogue' in Romania.""





He urged the authorities and the head of Mazare's Social Democrat party to show that message ""will be strongly countermanded.""





Mazare, 41, said he had not noticed the Nazi swastika symbol on the uniform before he wore it, according to the Romanian Times newspaper.





""I checked it before I put it on but the swastika was very small and I didn't see it,"" he said. ""I really liked the look of the uniform after seeing it in the Tom Cruise film 'Valkyrie.' I bought it from a costume hire shop in Germany.""





A top Nazi hunter said Mazare should quit.





""The proper thing for you to do is to admit your mistake, apologize for it and resign your position,"" Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem wrote to Mazare. Zuroff sent CNN a copy of the letter.





He said it was no defense that the uniform was that of the Wehrmacht -- the army -- rather than the SS, the elite Nazi guard which took the lead in killing Jews during the Holocaust.





""The Wehrmacht played an active role in the mass murder of European Jewry and many other innocent victims. By dressing in a Wehrmacht uniform, you are expressing totally unwarranted support and nostalgia for an army which committed the most terrible war crimes and acts of genocide,"" the letter said.





""It would hard to adequately describe the depth of the pain that your appearance caused, not only to Jews and other victims of Nazism, but to any person of moral integrity who knows the history of World War II,"" Zuroff wrote.





Zuroff told CNN he did not expect Mazare to resign, or even to respond to the letter.





But he said he hoped the mayor might act on Zuroff's suggestion that Mazare create a Romanian-language edition of an acclaimed exhibition on the crimes of the Wehrmacht.





The Nazi uniform incident, which took place Sunday, was the first time Zuroff heard of Mazare, he said.





""He has a history of being outrageous, but his antics have never included something that I would deal with,"" Zuroff said.





""He's a real character, apparently. He's also very popular, which makes this much more difficult.""





CNN attempts to contact Mazare were unsuccessful.





Romania was a Nazi ally from 1940 to 1944, under the leadership of a right-wing military government led by General Ion Antonescu.





At least 270,000 Romanian Jews were killed or died from mistreatment during the Holocaust, according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia.

The 1930 Romanian census recorded 728,115 people who identified themselves as Jewish, comprising approximately 4 percent of the population, the reference work says.

Radu Mazare, the mayor of the town of Constanta, wore a Nazi uniform during a fashion show over the weekend.





Radu Mazare, the mayor of the town of Constanta, and his 15-year-old son ""entered the stage marching the clearly identifiable Nazi 'goose step,'"" the Center for Monitoring and Combating anti-Semitism in Romania said in a letter to the country's prosecutor general.





The organization's director, Marco Katz, said Mazare had broken Romanian law and encouraged his son to do the same, ""educating him to treat the law with contempt.""





Katz said Mazare was sending a message ""that to wear Nazi uniforms and to march the Nazi steps is legal and 'in vogue' in Romania.""





He urged the authorities and the head of Mazare's Social Democrat party to show that message ""will be strongly countermanded.""





Mazare, 41, said he had not noticed the Nazi swastika symbol on the uniform before he wore it, according to the Romanian Times newspaper.





""I checked it before I put it on but the swastika was very small and I didn't see it,"" he said. ""I really liked the look of the uniform after seeing it in the Tom Cruise film 'Valkyrie.' I bought it from a costume hire shop in Germany.""





A top Nazi hunter said Mazare should quit.





""The proper thing for you to do is to admit your mistake, apologize for it and resign your position,"" Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem wrote to Mazare. Zuroff sent CNN a copy of the letter.





He said it was no defense that the uniform was that of the Wehrmacht -- the army -- rather than the SS, the elite Nazi guard which took the lead in killing Jews during the Holocaust.





""The Wehrmacht played an active role in the mass murder of European Jewry and many other innocent victims. By dressing in a Wehrmacht uniform, you are expressing totally unwarranted support and nostalgia for an army which committed the most terrible war crimes and acts of genocide,"" the letter said.





""It would hard to adequately describe the depth of the pain that your appearance caused, not only to Jews and other victims of Nazism, but to any person of moral integrity who knows the history of World War II,"" Zuroff wrote.





Zuroff told CNN he did not expect Mazare to resign, or even to respond to the letter.





But he said he hoped the mayor might act on Zuroff's suggestion that Mazare create a Romanian-language edition of an acclaimed exhibition on the crimes of the Wehrmacht.





The Nazi uniform incident, which took place Sunday, was the first time Zuroff heard of Mazare, he said.





""He has a history of being outrageous, but his antics have never included something that I would deal with,"" Zuroff said.





""He's a real character, apparently. He's also very popular, which makes this much more difficult.""

Within 48 hours of debuting with tweets about family, work and politics, Murdoch had pulled in more than 45,000 followers and stirred internet debate over why the 80-year-old was now embracing a technology often used to attack him.





The tweets also raised doubts that the notorious technophobe was writing the messages himself. Twitter creator Jack Dorsey -- one of only four people being followed by Murdoch -- however insisted that the media mogul was writing ""with his own voice, in his own way.""





Murdoch appears to have made his Twitter debut on New Year's Eve with a couple of brief comments on books including the biography of late Apple boss Steve Jobs, which he called ""interesting but unfair.""





These were followed by praise for cinema releases ""We Bought a Zoo,"" and ""The Descendants,"" both produced by Murdoch's Fox Movies. These fueled suspicions that Murdoch's Twitter account was being used as a publicity tool to help improve his image after a damaging year.





""Could be brilliant News Corp PR operation,"" Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff tweeted after earlier commenting: ""Might be somebody who knows Murdoch, but it's not Rupert (he doesn't use a computer unassisted nor get his own email).""





Others claimed that the voice of the tweets, as well as their faltering grammar and punctuation, were unmistakably Murdoch. ""You can tell by the tweets he's doing it himself,"" wrote CNN's Piers Morgan, a former editor of one of Murdoch's newspapers.





A spokesperson for Murdoch's News Corp. confirmed to CNN the account is genuine.





The account could offer new insight into a businessman whose life has been under intense scrutiny this year after revelations that journalists at News of the World, one of his most profitable newspapers, illegally accessed the voicemail messages of scores of celebrities and public figures.





Twitter played a prominent role at the height of the scandal when it was used to pressure advertisers into boycotting the paper. Commentators said the loss of revenue was a key factor in Murdoch's decision to shut the paper down.





Murdoch's subsequent appearance before a British parliamentary inquiry into phone hacking also caused a sensation on Twitter, particularly after his wife, Wendi Deng, pounced on a man who tried to attack him with a foam pie.





There were echoes of Murdoch's parliamentary appearance -- which he called the ""most humble day day of my life"" -- in New Year pledges which he tweeted in a January 1 message to Dorsey. ""My resolutions, try to maintain humility and always curiosity. And of course diet!""

./cnn/stories/66b8f1cd14d13ac3ad56954589d980def31be1b4.story,What is his age?,"(CNN) -- A phone hacking scandal may have cost Rupert Murdoch his biggest-selling newspaper in 2011, but the billionaire media mogul managed to end the year with a modest addition to his empire -- an account on Twitter.





Within 48 hours of debuting with tweets about family, work and politics, Murdoch had pulled in more than 45,000 followers and stirred internet debate over why the 80-year-old was now embracing a technology often used to attack him.





The tweets also raised doubts that the notorious technophobe was writing the messages himself. Twitter creator Jack Dorsey -- one of only four people being followed by Murdoch -- however insisted that the media mogul was writing ""with his own voice, in his own way.""





Murdoch appears to have made his Twitter debut on New Year's Eve with a couple of brief comments on books including the biography of late Apple boss Steve Jobs, which he called ""interesting but unfair.""





These were followed by praise for cinema releases ""We Bought a Zoo,"" and ""The Descendants,"" both produced by Murdoch's Fox Movies. These fueled suspicions that Murdoch's Twitter account was being used as a publicity tool to help improve his image after a damaging year.





""Could be brilliant News Corp PR operation,"" Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff tweeted after earlier commenting: ""Might be somebody who knows Murdoch, but it's not Rupert (he doesn't use a computer unassisted nor get his own email).""





Others claimed that the voice of the tweets, as well as their faltering grammar and punctuation, were unmistakably Murdoch. ""You can tell by the tweets he's doing it himself,"" wrote CNN's Piers Morgan, a former editor of one of Murdoch's newspapers.





A spokesperson for Murdoch's News Corp. confirmed to CNN the account is genuine.





The account could offer new insight into a businessman whose life has been under intense scrutiny this year after revelations that journalists at News of the World, one of his most profitable newspapers, illegally accessed the voicemail messages of scores of celebrities and public figures.





Twitter played a prominent role at the height of the scandal when it was used to pressure advertisers into boycotting the paper. Commentators said the loss of revenue was a key factor in Murdoch's decision to shut the paper down.





Murdoch's subsequent appearance before a British parliamentary inquiry into phone hacking also caused a sensation on Twitter, particularly after his wife, Wendi Deng, pounced on a man who tried to attack him with a foam pie.





There were echoes of Murdoch's parliamentary appearance -- which he called the ""most humble day day of my life"" -- in New Year pledges which he tweeted in a January 1 message to Dorsey. ""My resolutions, try to maintain humility and always curiosity. And of course diet!""





But there were also signs that the media mogul was still getting to grips with social media. Reports suggested he was forced to quickly delete one post -- possibly after Deng leapt to his aid once again.

Piven stopped by the CNN.com newsroom to talk with CNN's Nicole Lapin about his new film, ""The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard,"" in which he plays a used car salesman.



The following is an edited version of the interview:



CNN: [The movie] was hysterical, and my producer and I were sitting next to each other and we were trying to figure out -- is this like lowbrow, but it's smart, so it's medium-brow? Highbrow comedy?



Jeremy Piven: It's a hybrid-brow, or a unibrow. It's from the people who brought you ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Step Brothers"" and ""Anchorman,"" so from the kings of guys who make really smart, low-brow comedies, and I'm just insanely honored to be a part of it.



It's like a dream because my fear was that by the time Will [Ferrell] hit the screen that, worst-case scenario, the movie wouldn't be funny enough. So that when Will jumps out of the plane, he takes us to a whole other level -- it's like, ""Oh my God, Will Ferrell is so brilliant."" But the reality is, the movie was so funny up until that moment that it was really, it was kind of organic, and it sustained it and it was really fantastic.

James Brolin would go home to his wife, Barbra Streisand, at night, and I would say, ""James, is she OK with all this?""

Piven: Yes, I think you're right. The movie is OK'd by Barbra Streisand; she vetted the whole thing.

CNN: Anything is possible, even in some 40 some movies in your career, but this is the first lead in a while, I mean did it take you a while to get into the used car salesman character?

As soon as they see me coming in, they know they're going to take my money. So I kind of took that, and I reversed it and I'm no longer a sucker.

Police launched a huge manhunt Wednesday after a passenger appeared to flee from security officers when his laptop computer bag tested positive for explosives, they said.





Police originally said authorities wanted to take the man in for further testing after his bag set off suspicions, but he ran. They said a bomb squad was testing the bag to see if it really contained explosives.





But authorities later said the man may simply have been in a hurry, grabbed his things and left the airport.





They do not have the laptop case, they said.





They are still trying to find the man, they said, but are no longer describing the search as a huge manhunt.





Police earlier said they were reviewing airport security videos to try to figure out where the man went. It was not clear if that was what caused them to change their evaluation of the situation.





Police did not know which flight the man was booked on.





Part of the airport was shut down after the suspect fled, but was later reopened.





All planes in the area of Terminal 2, where the incident took place, were evacuated and all luggage was removed, police said. The passengers had to leave the secure area and be rescreened, an airport representative told CNN, adding that the airport was otherwise operating normally.





About 100 flights were affected by the security measures. Some were canceled and others were delayed, the airport said, adding that activity has slowly begun to return to normal.





The airport Web site was still showing some delays to flights leaving Terminal 2 several hours after the incident.





The incident took place as a United States Senate committee debated the foiled Christmas Day attack aboard a plane bound from Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Detroit, Michigan.





The committee chairman, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Connecticut, said it is ""infuriating"" that the December 25 suspect, Nigerian Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, was able to board the plane in the Netherlands with a U.S. visa.





Janet Napolitano, secretary of homeland security, said AbdulMutallab ""was not on the no-fly list, which would've flagged him to be prevented from boarding, nor was he on the selectee list, which would've flagged him for secondary screening.""





""Furthermore, the physical screening performed by foreign authorities at airports in Nigeria and the Netherlands did not detect explosives on his body,"" Napolitano said. ""As this incident underscores, aviation security is increasingly an international responsibility.""

./cnn/stories/35d22b9240d034815afd9fc03edd3a1dcf2df1ae.story,what tested positive for explosives?,"Berlin, Germany (CNN)  -- A bomb scare that affected about 100 flights at Munich Airport in Germany on Wednesday may have been a false alarm, German police told CNN.





Police launched a huge manhunt Wednesday after a passenger appeared to flee from security officers when his laptop computer bag tested positive for explosives, they said.





Police originally said authorities wanted to take the man in for further testing after his bag set off suspicions, but he ran. They said a bomb squad was testing the bag to see if it really contained explosives.





But authorities later said the man may simply have been in a hurry, grabbed his things and left the airport.





They do not have the laptop case, they said.





They are still trying to find the man, they said, but are no longer describing the search as a huge manhunt.





Police earlier said they were reviewing airport security videos to try to figure out where the man went. It was not clear if that was what caused them to change their evaluation of the situation.





Police did not know which flight the man was booked on.





Part of the airport was shut down after the suspect fled, but was later reopened.





All planes in the area of Terminal 2, where the incident took place, were evacuated and all luggage was removed, police said. The passengers had to leave the secure area and be rescreened, an airport representative told CNN, adding that the airport was otherwise operating normally.





About 100 flights were affected by the security measures. Some were canceled and others were delayed, the airport said, adding that activity has slowly begun to return to normal.





The airport Web site was still showing some delays to flights leaving Terminal 2 several hours after the incident.





The incident took place as a United States Senate committee debated the foiled Christmas Day attack aboard a plane bound from Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Detroit, Michigan.





The committee chairman, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Connecticut, said it is ""infuriating"" that the December 25 suspect, Nigerian Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, was able to board the plane in the Netherlands with a U.S. visa.





Janet Napolitano, secretary of homeland security, said AbdulMutallab ""was not on the no-fly list, which would've flagged him to be prevented from boarding, nor was he on the selectee list, which would've flagged him for secondary screening.""





""Furthermore, the physical screening performed by foreign authorities at airports in Nigeria and the Netherlands did not detect explosives on his body,"" Napolitano said. ""As this incident underscores, aviation security is increasingly an international responsibility.""

Designer Yigal Azrou├лl talks with students at the Savannah College of Art and Design.



""Bravery,"" says Isabel Toledo, designer of the first lady's attention-grabbing lemongrass yellow wool and lace ensemble that she wore for the inauguration of her husband President Obama.



But along with bravery about their fashion sense, new graduates at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) will need courage in the face of the current recession.



""Fashion is being hit particularly hard in the new job market. Fashion as a whole is feeling a greater level of lost revenues and in turn has lost opportunities for sustaining volume and even more so for growth,"" said Marshal Cohen, chief analyst and expert fashion analyst for the NPD market research group.



""The ironic thing is that new ideas and creations are just what the industry needs but is too cautious to react to it,"" he added.



Full of new ideas, student designers say they are aware of the challenges as they head out into the work force, but they're optimistic they can make it in these tough times.



""After I graduate, I'm going to New York, I have an internship lined up with a trend forecasting company, Promostyl,"" said Shelby Simon whose designs made it into SCAD's annual fashion show.  See the runway fashions ┬╗



""Everyone needs an assistant so hopefully I'll be able to find something pretty easily,"" said Caitlin Clarke. She would like to land an internship in New York and has interviewed with New York & Co. and applied for positions at Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein and Zac Posen.



Toledo, a world-renown designer, knows it can be tough to make it in fashion. She and her fashion illustrator husband Ruben Toledo didn't have much money when they arrived from Cuba in the late 60s as political refugees. She says she found inspiration in the little things.  Experts' advice on getting to top of fashion business ┬╗



""Go out there and look at things, look at things well. Study them; the smallest things can inspire you. That will make you able to do what you want on any level. Many times kids think you have to have all this backing coming into a big industry. I didn't do that, I started from the bottom and as a matter of fact you can only go up,"" said Isabel Toledo.



Toledo was at the school last weekend to accept the 2009 Andr├й Leon Talley Lifetime Achievement Award.



But for six months, two other top designers, Yigal Azrou├лl and Lars Nilsson, have been mentoring and critiquing 23 students to help them develop their designs for the runway.



Azrou├лl, a self-taught designer, says it's a tough industry and students have to pay their dues.



""It's not what people think it is or what it looks like from the outside. If you want to be a fashion designer you have to carry fabric on your back, you need to learn how to cut and sew. The fame is going to come later.""



More known for his expert draping techniques, Yigal Azrou├лl taught students more than how to incorporate intricate folds and pleats in their designs.



""If you love something, go ahead and do it, but, be very consistent with it,"" advised Azrou├лl.



SCAD senior Caitlin Clarke says working with Nilsson really helped her create new silhouettes and structured angles with interesting seams.



""Lars was so helpful. I remember this one time when he came in and said 'Ah, there's something not right with this dress' and then he helped me cut it up and fix it,"" said Clarke.



Nilsson enjoyed the process.



""I really tried to spend a lot of time seeing what they [the students] had to say, giving them advice and push them forward to express themselves,"" said Nilsson. ""It's been a great collaboration, and I must say that I've learned a lot myself, too.""



The visiting designers give the students an edge in their job search, says SCAD president Paula Wallace. ""It's very important to bring in the top professionals because they inspire the students and they provide contacts and networking for the students after they graduate.""



Students are also using social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and MySpace to reach out to their peers and other industry professionals. In order to succeed you have to have innovative approaches to market, sell and sustain your product lines, said retail analyst Hitha Prabhakar.



Right now retailers are in ""survival of the fittest"" mode and a handful of designers including Mui Mui, Allessandro Del Acqua, Allegra Hicks and Krizia have had to shut their store doors on Madison Avenue, she said.



SCAD senior Shelby Simon feels some students went into fashion because they like to shop, but she warns there is so much more to learn about the craft..



""The truth is hard work, nose to the grind stone and learning. All the people I know who became great designers didn't do it over night,"" said Vogue magazine's editor-at-large Andr├й Leon Talley, who has been involved with SCAD students over the years.

""Go out there and look at things, look at things well. Study them; the smallest things can inspire you. That will make you able to do what you want on any level. Many times kids think you have to have all this backing coming into a big industry. I didn't do that, I started from the bottom and as a matter of fact you can only go up,"" said Isabel Toledo.



Toledo was at the school last weekend to accept the 2009 Andr├й Leon Talley Lifetime Achievement Award.



But for six months, two other top designers, Yigal Azrou├лl and Lars Nilsson, have been mentoring and critiquing 23 students to help them develop their designs for the runway.



Azrou├лl, a self-taught designer, says it's a tough industry and students have to pay their dues.



""It's not what people think it is or what it looks like from the outside. If you want to be a fashion designer you have to carry fabric on your back, you need to learn how to cut and sew. The fame is going to come later.""



More known for his expert draping techniques, Yigal Azrou├лl taught students more than how to incorporate intricate folds and pleats in their designs.



""If you love something, go ahead and do it, but, be very consistent with it,"" advised Azrou├лl.



SCAD senior Caitlin Clarke says working with Nilsson really helped her create new silhouettes and structured angles with interesting seams.



""Lars was so helpful. I remember this one time when he came in and said 'Ah, there's something not right with this dress' and then he helped me cut it up and fix it,"" said Clarke.



Nilsson enjoyed the process.



""I really tried to spend a lot of time seeing what they [the students] had to say, giving them advice and push them forward to express themselves,"" said Nilsson. ""It's been a great collaboration, and I must say that I've learned a lot myself, too.""



The visiting designers give the students an edge in their job search, says SCAD president Paula Wallace. ""It's very important to bring in the top professionals because they inspire the students and they provide contacts and networking for the students after they graduate.""



Students are also using social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and MySpace to reach out to their peers and other industry professionals. In order to succeed you have to have innovative approaches to market, sell and sustain your product lines, said retail analyst Hitha Prabhakar.



Right now retailers are in ""survival of the fittest"" mode and a handful of designers including Mui Mui, Allessandro Del Acqua, Allegra Hicks and Krizia have had to shut their store doors on Madison Avenue, she said.



SCAD senior Shelby Simon feels some students went into fashion because they like to shop, but she warns there is so much more to learn about the craft..



""The truth is hard work, nose to the grind stone and learning. All the people I know who became great designers didn't do it over night,"" said Vogue magazine's editor-at-large Andr├й Leon Talley, who has been involved with SCAD students over the years.

Les Paul was constantly making recommendations on how to improve guitars, says the CEO of Gibson.



Juszkiewicz, the chairman and CEO of Gibson Guitars, remembers getting calls from his company's partner (and famed client), offering recommendations on how to change or market his eponymous Gibson guitars.



Sometimes, Juszkiewicz recalls, the two would go out for Chinese food. Paul was very particular, desiring a dish called Chicken Subgum. The two would have to search Chinatown for a restaurant that knew how to cook it, he says with a chuckle.



Les Paul died Thursday of pneumonia. He was 94.



Juszkiewicz talked about his friend and colleague Thursday afternoon. The following is an edited version of the interview.  Watch how Les Paul helped invent modern music ┬╗



CNN: Tell me about working with Les Paul.



Henry Juszkiewicz: I've been with Gibson about 25 years and known Les pretty much through that entire period. ... Les was a very kind person. He was a visionary.



In the early days, Gibson was doing very poorly as a company, and I got involved essentially to turn the company around. ... We had many, many conversations about the guitar business and what to do. ... A lot of the things we talked about and implemented were very successful.



CNN: What was distinctive about the Gibson Les Paul when it came out, and what remains distinctive about it?  Gallery: Guitarists pay tribute to Les Paul ┬╗



Juszkiewicz: When it first came out, it was extremely controversial, and it was not really successful. It took years for Gibson to actually come to terms with Les. He had been pitching the head of what was Gibson's parent company, CMI, for three or four years until they finally decided to give it a try -- and only then when he became very famous and a television personality.



And they were right, actually, because a solid-body guitar was considered silly. ... It really wasn't until 1965, '66 that the guitar took off and became popular. In fact, in the early '60s, the guitar was discontinued for several years. One of the [prized] Les Pauls was the 1959 Les Paul -- that's sort of the holy grail of Les Pauls -- and one of the reasons is there were only 300 units made in 1959. And 300 units was not really that successful for Gibson; it was a powerhouse guitar builder in 1959.



So Les was always ahead of his time. He was someone who could see what was going to happen 50 years in advance, and very often, he was able to bring his vision to reality and share it with the entire musical community. ...



The [Les Paul] guitar shines in modern music. ... In the '50s and before the '50s, the [standard] guitar was amplified, but it was just louder. In other words, it still sounded just like an acoustic guitar, but you could turn it up. What Les did was turn it into a whole new instrument. When he was playing ... you will hear this rich context that's kind of normal today. ...



CNN: Les Paul being Les Paul, I assumed he continue to play with things over the years.



Juszkiewicz: Yeah, he would call me all the time and give me suggestions. It's really hard to answer your original question, what makes it [distinctive]. ... As a guitar player, when I pick it up, I know it's a Les Paul. I can feel the sustain. It's got a certain feeling. ... There's a lot of things in it. But it's the package that's kind of magic. In the modern world, working with modern equipment, it's incomparable.



CNN: How many Les Pauls do you sell nowadays?



Juszkiewicz: A lot. Many, many thousands.



I'll share with you: We had a big debate when we first got involved in the business. When I was a young guitar player, Les Pauls were always very expensive ... and they're very expensive today. [Paul] said, ""You know, Henry, you really have to make a less expensive Les Paul."" ... We argued about it for a year and a half, and finally I gave in. I said, ""OK, Les, it's your guitar."" ...



And it was an instant success. And all of a sudden, people that couldn't touch that magic got a shot at it, and he was pleased as punch, and we were as well.



He was a renaissance man. ... What a life. And what a wonderful, warm gentleman.",639,648,when does paul died

Les Paul was constantly making recommendations on how to improve guitars, says the CEO of Gibson.



Juszkiewicz, the chairman and CEO of Gibson Guitars, remembers getting calls from his company's partner (and famed client), offering recommendations on how to change or market his eponymous Gibson guitars.



Sometimes, Juszkiewicz recalls, the two would go out for Chinese food. Paul was very particular, desiring a dish called Chicken Subgum. The two would have to search Chinatown for a restaurant that knew how to cook it, he says with a chuckle.



Les Paul died Thursday of pneumonia. He was 94.



Juszkiewicz talked about his friend and colleague Thursday afternoon. The following is an edited version of the interview.  Watch how Les Paul helped invent modern music ┬╗



CNN: Tell me about working with Les Paul.



Henry Juszkiewicz: I've been with Gibson about 25 years and known Les pretty much through that entire period. ... Les was a very kind person. He was a visionary.



In the early days, Gibson was doing very poorly as a company, and I got involved essentially to turn the company around. ... We had many, many conversations about the guitar business and what to do. ... A lot of the things we talked about and implemented were very successful.



CNN: What was distinctive about the Gibson Les Paul when it came out, and what remains distinctive about it?  Gallery: Guitarists pay tribute to Les Paul ┬╗



Juszkiewicz: When it first came out, it was extremely controversial, and it was not really successful. It took years for Gibson to actually come to terms with Les. He had been pitching the head of what was Gibson's parent company, CMI, for three or four years until they finally decided to give it a try -- and only then when he became very famous and a television personality.



And they were right, actually, because a solid-body guitar was considered silly. ... It really wasn't until 1965, '66 that the guitar took off and became popular. In fact, in the early '60s, the guitar was discontinued for several years. One of the [prized] Les Pauls was the 1959 Les Paul -- that's sort of the holy grail of Les Pauls -- and one of the reasons is there were only 300 units made in 1959. And 300 units was not really that successful for Gibson; it was a powerhouse guitar builder in 1959.



So Les was always ahead of his time. He was someone who could see what was going to happen 50 years in advance, and very often, he was able to bring his vision to reality and share it with the entire musical community. ...



The [Les Paul] guitar shines in modern music. ... In the '50s and before the '50s, the [standard] guitar was amplified, but it was just louder. In other words, it still sounded just like an acoustic guitar, but you could turn it up. What Les did was turn it into a whole new instrument. When he was playing ... you will hear this rich context that's kind of normal today. ...

""Peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the U.N.,"" Obama said, addressing delegates at the 66th annual session of U.N. General Assembly. ""If it were that easy, it would have been accomplished by now.""





The United States has vowed to block a Palestinian membership application should it reach the Security Council, but is likely eager to head off a scenario that would involve an American veto -- a move widely seen as unpopular across the Middle East.





A formal request for full U.N. membership is expected to be submitted Friday.





""One year ago, I stood at this podium and called for an independent Palestine,"" Obama added. ""I believed then -- and I believe now -- that the Palestinian people deserve a state of their own. But what I also said is that genuine peace can only be realized between Israelis and Palestinians themselves.""





A year later, despite extensive U.S. efforts, ""the parties have not bridged their differences,"" Obama said.





The American president met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and declared the bonds between their two countries ""unbreakable,"" a move likely to play well at home in an increasingly volatile U.S. political landscape.





Though Netanyahu was not in attendance at the General Assembly during Obama's speech, he called the U.S. position a ""badge of honor,"" and has pushed for a resumption of talks, beginning in New York and continuing in Ramallah and Jerusalem.





Peace negotiations broke down last year.





Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas met with Obama later Wednesday, part of a whirlwind of diplomatic wrangling that has accompanied his proposed move. Obama reiterated his stance on the need for a two-state solution, officials said.





Abbas met earlier with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who promised the request would be taken ""very seriously,"" according to Nabeel Shaath, a senior negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization. Shaath told CNN it had not been decided if the formal application would be submitted the U.N. secretary-general before or after Abbas addresses the General Assembly early Friday afternoon.





Ban said it will ""not take long"" to get Security Council consideration.





Shaath added that settling for a lesser status -- such as being recognized as a non-member state -- is one option under consideration if the push for full membership is blocked. But the Palestinians do not want ""anybody to suspect a lack of seriousness,"" he said.





Palestinians' current status at the United Nations is as an observer ""entity."" Observers can speak in the General Assembly but not vote.





While a veto by the United States in the Security Council would block any effort to gain full U.N. membership, a ""yes"" vote in the General Assembly -- where only a majority would be needed -- would raise Palestinians to the status of permanent observer ""state,"" the status the Vatican currently holds.





Abbas' effort to gain U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state is opposed by Hamas, the Palestinian organization that controls Gaza. It has warned Abbas against making the request, saying it would show a willingness to acknowledge and negotiate with Israel, which would ""deprive the Palestinian people from their right to come back to their homeland.""





As national leaders took to rostrum Wednesday to spell out their visions for global peace and security, attention at the U.N. General Assembly seemed to center on the potential membership bid.





French President Nicolas Sarkozy urged the body to recognize Palestine as a non-member state, calling for a more definitive timetable for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. But he also warned that a U.S. veto of the bid for full membership in the Security Council could be dangerous and might spark violence.





Argentinean President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner seemed to agree, adding that ""non-inclusion of Palestine (at the United Nations) this year will create greater insecurity.""





The Palestinian leader said he will personally deliver the application to the U.N. Security Council, but does not expect the body to act immediately, according to Palestinian officials.





They say Abbas is expected to deliver the letter before he leaves New York on Friday, but added that he will give both the United Nations and American leadership several weeks to respond to the letter -- temporarily averting a diplomatic showdown.





Abbas will wait for a response from the diplomatic Quartet on the Middle East, the officials said, and then return to the U.N. General Assembly to negotiate statehood recognition, working through the U.N. Security Council.





Abbas' goal, according to the officials, is to legitimize Palestinian statehood by eventually forcing a vote.





Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, who kicked off the opening round of speeches at the assembly's 66th session, joined the chorus of voices on Wednesday calling on the council to approve the Palestinian bid.





Her speech marked the first time a woman has commenced the annual proceeding, reflecting a moment of equality at the start of what she described as ""the century of women.""





Also Wednesday, Obama pressed Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan --- an increasingly vocal critic of Israel -- to continue work toward patching up their strained relationship, officials said.





The U.N. chief, meanwhile, also focused on a series of other issues highlighted during the annual session, particularly the spread of noncommunicable diseases, empowering women, food security and climate change.





""Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth -- these are one and the same fight,"" said Ban. ""Today, I call on you to reach a binding climate change agreement -- an agreement with more ambitious national and global emissions targets.""





Thirty-one of the world body's 193 delegates are expected to address the assembly this week.





Brazil has traditionally opened the session since the days of former American president Harry Truman, when the U.N. was in its infancy. It was founded in 1945 after World War II.

Abbas' goal, according to the officials, is to legitimize Palestinian statehood by eventually forcing a vote.





Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, who kicked off the opening round of speeches at the assembly's 66th session, joined the chorus of voices on Wednesday calling on the council to approve the Palestinian bid.





Her speech marked the first time a woman has commenced the annual proceeding, reflecting a moment of equality at the start of what she described as ""the century of women.""





Also Wednesday, Obama pressed Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan --- an increasingly vocal critic of Israel -- to continue work toward patching up their strained relationship, officials said.





The U.N. chief, meanwhile, also focused on a series of other issues highlighted during the annual session, particularly the spread of noncommunicable diseases, empowering women, food security and climate change.





""Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth -- these are one and the same fight,"" said Ban. ""Today, I call on you to reach a binding climate change agreement -- an agreement with more ambitious national and global emissions targets.""





Thirty-one of the world body's 193 delegates are expected to address the assembly this week.





Brazil has traditionally opened the session since the days of former American president Harry Truman, when the U.N. was in its infancy. It was founded in 1945 after World War II.

./cnn/stories/4d181b23eb2a5c73f17f6c6c8856ad246041af95.story,What will the UN do?,"United Nations (CNN) -- Confronted with the prospect of a Palestinian bid for full U.N. membership, U.S. President Barack Obama issued a sharp rebuke Wednesday to those pressing for statehood -- a rebuke likely to bring criticism from the Arab world.





""Peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the U.N.,"" Obama said, addressing delegates at the 66th annual session of U.N. General Assembly. ""If it were that easy, it would have been accomplished by now.""





The United States has vowed to block a Palestinian membership application should it reach the Security Council, but is likely eager to head off a scenario that would involve an American veto -- a move widely seen as unpopular across the Middle East.





A formal request for full U.N. membership is expected to be submitted Friday.





""One year ago, I stood at this podium and called for an independent Palestine,"" Obama added. ""I believed then -- and I believe now -- that the Palestinian people deserve a state of their own. But what I also said is that genuine peace can only be realized between Israelis and Palestinians themselves.""





A year later, despite extensive U.S. efforts, ""the parties have not bridged their differences,"" Obama said.





The American president met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and declared the bonds between their two countries ""unbreakable,"" a move likely to play well at home in an increasingly volatile U.S. political landscape.





Though Netanyahu was not in attendance at the General Assembly during Obama's speech, he called the U.S. position a ""badge of honor,"" and has pushed for a resumption of talks, beginning in New York and continuing in Ramallah and Jerusalem.





Peace negotiations broke down last year.





Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas met with Obama later Wednesday, part of a whirlwind of diplomatic wrangling that has accompanied his proposed move. Obama reiterated his stance on the need for a two-state solution, officials said.





Abbas met earlier with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who promised the request would be taken ""very seriously,"" according to Nabeel Shaath, a senior negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization. Shaath told CNN it had not been decided if the formal application would be submitted the U.N. secretary-general before or after Abbas addresses the General Assembly early Friday afternoon.





Ban said it will ""not take long"" to get Security Council consideration.





Shaath added that settling for a lesser status -- such as being recognized as a non-member state -- is one option under consideration if the push for full membership is blocked. But the Palestinians do not want ""anybody to suspect a lack of seriousness,"" he said.





Palestinians' current status at the United Nations is as an observer ""entity."" Observers can speak in the General Assembly but not vote.





While a veto by the United States in the Security Council would block any effort to gain full U.N. membership, a ""yes"" vote in the General Assembly -- where only a majority would be needed -- would raise Palestinians to the status of permanent observer ""state,"" the status the Vatican currently holds.





Abbas' effort to gain U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state is opposed by Hamas, the Palestinian organization that controls Gaza. It has warned Abbas against making the request, saying it would show a willingness to acknowledge and negotiate with Israel, which would ""deprive the Palestinian people from their right to come back to their homeland.""





As national leaders took to rostrum Wednesday to spell out their visions for global peace and security, attention at the U.N. General Assembly seemed to center on the potential membership bid.





French President Nicolas Sarkozy urged the body to recognize Palestine as a non-member state, calling for a more definitive timetable for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. But he also warned that a U.S. veto of the bid for full membership in the Security Council could be dangerous and might spark violence.





Argentinean President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner seemed to agree, adding that ""non-inclusion of Palestine (at the United Nations) this year will create greater insecurity.""





The Palestinian leader said he will personally deliver the application to the U.N. Security Council, but does not expect the body to act immediately, according to Palestinian officials.





They say Abbas is expected to deliver the letter before he leaves New York on Friday, but added that he will give both the United Nations and American leadership several weeks to respond to the letter -- temporarily averting a diplomatic showdown.





Abbas will wait for a response from the diplomatic Quartet on the Middle East, the officials said, and then return to the U.N. General Assembly to negotiate statehood recognition, working through the U.N. Security Council.

Philip Markoff is accused in the the fatal shooting of one woman and the robbery another in Boston hotels earlier this year.



A Massachusetts grand jury late last week indicted him on seven counts, including first-degree murder.



Markoff is charged with the April 14 fatal shooting and attempted robbery of Julissa Brisman, 25, and the armed robbery of a 29-year-old Las Vegas woman on April 10. Investigators have linked both crimes to ads on the popular Web site Craigslist.

1. When is Black History Month observed? When did Black History Month get its start? Who was Dr. Carter G. Woodson? What was his role in the establishment of Black History Month?





2. What are some significant events and milestones in U.S. black history? Who are some of the individuals who have contributed to black history?





3. How does black history help to tell the story of what it means to be an American? How have African-Americans enriched that story? What lessons can be learned from the experiences of black history makers?





Learning Activities





Use these activities to encourage your students to learn about and appreciate the history, culture and achievements of African-Americans.





1. A Milestone in U.S. History





Remind students that they have witnessed a truly historical event in their lifetime: the election of Barack Obama as the first African-American president. What will they remember about this milestone? What do they want future generations to know about it? Challenge students to write letters to students who will be in their place 100 years from now, describing the event and its significance for all Americans. Combine the letters into a book or a Web site, or create a video of students reading their letters. Present the finished product to your school's historian or media specialist for archiving.





2. Covering Black History





Ask students: What if CNN correspondents had been on the scene to record key moments in black history for the entire world to see? Organize students into small teams of reporters, and have each team select a time period in American history and a key figure or event that helped to define that time period for African-Americans. Then, have students imagine that CNN was there to cover the historical figure or event. Ask: How do you think that CNN reporters might have covered these stories? Encourage the teams to write scripts for news stories on their historical figures and events. After students have presented their scripts, have them compare their reports to eyewitness accounts and local newspaper reports that were written at the time.





3. Harlem Renaissance





Inform students that during the 1920s and 1930s, an African-American cultural movement occurred in the United States that was known as the Harlem Renaissance. It was a literary, musical and artistic explosion that was born in Harlem, New York, and it had a profound impact on African-American culture and on the U.S. as a whole. Have your class host a Harlem Renaissance cultural fair. Direct students to online resources to learn about some of the great artists, writers and musicians who were part of the renaissance and their contribution to this cultural movement.





Have each student select one of these African-American artists and design a display that tells about the life and times of the artist and the importance of his or her work. Invite guests from your school and community to attend the exhibit. Have students serve as ""roaming curators"" to instruct and interest guests in the Harlem Renaissance and the creative works of these great African-Americans.





4. Profiles in Black History





Do your students show a personal interest in science, music, politics, theater, sports or education? Inspire them to celebrate the contributions of African-Americans by having them write profiles of African-Americans in the categories that interest them. For example, a budding young scientist might choose to profile the inventor of the ironing board, the lawn mower or the space shuttle retrieval arm, all of whom were/are African-Americans. Direct your students to online and print resources and have them conduct research on their chosen individuals. Then, encourage students to write proposals to have their selected persons commemorated in new postage stamps. Students should accompany their proposals with designs for the stamps. In their presentations, students should try to convince classmates why their profiled persons should have a stamp created in their name. Post the designs around the classroom.





5. Local African-American History





Valuable lessons in black history may be found just a few steps away in the stories and documents that can be found in local libraries, historical organizations, universities or colleges, and online. Encourage students to venture out into the community to investigate the history and contributions of black Americans in their city or town. Students might choose to use milestones in black history as a way to organize their research, gathering information on how those events impacted the community and its residents. They may also decide to profile influential black community members. Have students invite community members to a celebration of local black history.





6. Black History Museum





Celebrate black history by creating plans for a local Black History Museum. First, have students decide where the museum should be housed. Suggestions might include a school or local library, an exhibit in an existing history museum, or perhaps a virtual online museum. Next, discuss how the museum should be organized. Students may choose to categorize the content by theme, by specific time periods, by specific dates, by people or by local landmarks. Encourage students to include interactive elements and multimedia in their plans. Then, challenge students to consider what people, events or contributions to include in their Black History Museum. Ask: What messages or lessons do you want visitors to take away from the exhibits?





7. Not Just for February





Inform students that, while Dr. Carter G. Woodson chose the month of February to recognize the accomplishments of African-Americans, black history can be celebrated all year long. Challenge students to create year-long calendars or timelines that highlight the contributions of African-American newsmakers, illustrate key events in black history, and encourage an ongoing celebration of black culture.

Use these activities to encourage your students to learn about and appreciate the history, culture and achievements of African-Americans.





1. A Milestone in U.S. History





Remind students that they have witnessed a truly historical event in their lifetime: the election of Barack Obama as the first African-American president. What will they remember about this milestone? What do they want future generations to know about it? Challenge students to write letters to students who will be in their place 100 years from now, describing the event and its significance for all Americans. Combine the letters into a book or a Web site, or create a video of students reading their letters. Present the finished product to your school's historian or media specialist for archiving.





2. Covering Black History





Ask students: What if CNN correspondents had been on the scene to record key moments in black history for the entire world to see? Organize students into small teams of reporters, and have each team select a time period in American history and a key figure or event that helped to define that time period for African-Americans. Then, have students imagine that CNN was there to cover the historical figure or event. Ask: How do you think that CNN reporters might have covered these stories? Encourage the teams to write scripts for news stories on their historical figures and events. After students have presented their scripts, have them compare their reports to eyewitness accounts and local newspaper reports that were written at the time.





3. Harlem Renaissance





Inform students that during the 1920s and 1930s, an African-American cultural movement occurred in the United States that was known as the Harlem Renaissance. It was a literary, musical and artistic explosion that was born in Harlem, New York, and it had a profound impact on African-American culture and on the U.S. as a whole. Have your class host a Harlem Renaissance cultural fair. Direct students to online resources to learn about some of the great artists, writers and musicians who were part of the renaissance and their contribution to this cultural movement.





Have each student select one of these African-American artists and design a display that tells about the life and times of the artist and the importance of his or her work. Invite guests from your school and community to attend the exhibit. Have students serve as ""roaming curators"" to instruct and interest guests in the Harlem Renaissance and the creative works of these great African-Americans.





4. Profiles in Black History





Do your students show a personal interest in science, music, politics, theater, sports or education? Inspire them to celebrate the contributions of African-Americans by having them write profiles of African-Americans in the categories that interest them. For example, a budding young scientist might choose to profile the inventor of the ironing board, the lawn mower or the space shuttle retrieval arm, all of whom were/are African-Americans. Direct your students to online and print resources and have them conduct research on their chosen individuals. Then, encourage students to write proposals to have their selected persons commemorated in new postage stamps. Students should accompany their proposals with designs for the stamps. In their presentations, students should try to convince classmates why their profiled persons should have a stamp created in their name. Post the designs around the classroom.





5. Local African-American History





Valuable lessons in black history may be found just a few steps away in the stories and documents that can be found in local libraries, historical organizations, universities or colleges, and online. Encourage students to venture out into the community to investigate the history and contributions of black Americans in their city or town. Students might choose to use milestones in black history as a way to organize their research, gathering information on how those events impacted the community and its residents. They may also decide to profile influential black community members. Have students invite community members to a celebration of local black history.





6. Black History Museum





Celebrate black history by creating plans for a local Black History Museum. First, have students decide where the museum should be housed. Suggestions might include a school or local library, an exhibit in an existing history museum, or perhaps a virtual online museum. Next, discuss how the museum should be organized. Students may choose to categorize the content by theme, by specific time periods, by specific dates, by people or by local landmarks. Encourage students to include interactive elements and multimedia in their plans. Then, challenge students to consider what people, events or contributions to include in their Black History Museum. Ask: What messages or lessons do you want visitors to take away from the exhibits?





7. Not Just for February





Inform students that, while Dr. Carter G. Woodson chose the month of February to recognize the accomplishments of African-Americans, black history can be celebrated all year long. Challenge students to create year-long calendars or timelines that highlight the contributions of African-American newsmakers, illustrate key events in black history, and encourage an ongoing celebration of black culture.

For example, a budding young scientist might choose to profile the inventor of the ironing board, the lawn mower or the space shuttle retrieval arm, all of whom were/are African-Americans. Direct your students to online and print resources and have them conduct research on their chosen individuals. Then, encourage students to write proposals to have their selected persons commemorated in new postage stamps. Students should accompany their proposals with designs for the stamps. In their presentations, students should try to convince classmates why their profiled persons should have a stamp created in their name. Post the designs around the classroom.





5. Local African-American History





Valuable lessons in black history may be found just a few steps away in the stories and documents that can be found in local libraries, historical organizations, universities or colleges, and online. Encourage students to venture out into the community to investigate the history and contributions of black Americans in their city or town. Students might choose to use milestones in black history as a way to organize their research, gathering information on how those events impacted the community and its residents. They may also decide to profile influential black community members. Have students invite community members to a celebration of local black history.





6. Black History Museum





Celebrate black history by creating plans for a local Black History Museum. First, have students decide where the museum should be housed. Suggestions might include a school or local library, an exhibit in an existing history museum, or perhaps a virtual online museum. Next, discuss how the museum should be organized. Students may choose to categorize the content by theme, by specific time periods, by specific dates, by people or by local landmarks. Encourage students to include interactive elements and multimedia in their plans. Then, challenge students to consider what people, events or contributions to include in their Black History Museum. Ask: What messages or lessons do you want visitors to take away from the exhibits?





7. Not Just for February





Inform students that, while Dr. Carter G. Woodson chose the month of February to recognize the accomplishments of African-Americans, black history can be celebrated all year long. Challenge students to create year-long calendars or timelines that highlight the contributions of African-American newsmakers, illustrate key events in black history, and encourage an ongoing celebration of black culture.

./cnn/stories/b0e3514a8b6859bbf897f09721e93fc9afea248a.story,When is Black History Month?,"(CNN Student News)  -- Discussion Questions





1. When is Black History Month observed? When did Black History Month get its start? Who was Dr. Carter G. Woodson? What was his role in the establishment of Black History Month?





2. What are some significant events and milestones in U.S. black history? Who are some of the individuals who have contributed to black history?





3. How does black history help to tell the story of what it means to be an American? How have African-Americans enriched that story? What lessons can be learned from the experiences of black history makers?





Learning Activities





Use these activities to encourage your students to learn about and appreciate the history, culture and achievements of African-Americans.





1. A Milestone in U.S. History





Remind students that they have witnessed a truly historical event in their lifetime: the election of Barack Obama as the first African-American president. What will they remember about this milestone? What do they want future generations to know about it? Challenge students to write letters to students who will be in their place 100 years from now, describing the event and its significance for all Americans. Combine the letters into a book or a Web site, or create a video of students reading their letters. Present the finished product to your school's historian or media specialist for archiving.





2. Covering Black History





Ask students: What if CNN correspondents had been on the scene to record key moments in black history for the entire world to see? Organize students into small teams of reporters, and have each team select a time period in American history and a key figure or event that helped to define that time period for African-Americans. Then, have students imagine that CNN was there to cover the historical figure or event. Ask: How do you think that CNN reporters might have covered these stories? Encourage the teams to write scripts for news stories on their historical figures and events. After students have presented their scripts, have them compare their reports to eyewitness accounts and local newspaper reports that were written at the time.





3. Harlem Renaissance





Inform students that during the 1920s and 1930s, an African-American cultural movement occurred in the United States that was known as the Harlem Renaissance. It was a literary, musical and artistic explosion that was born in Harlem, New York, and it had a profound impact on African-American culture and on the U.S. as a whole. Have your class host a Harlem Renaissance cultural fair. Direct students to online resources to learn about some of the great artists, writers and musicians who were part of the renaissance and their contribution to this cultural movement.





Have each student select one of these African-American artists and design a display that tells about the life and times of the artist and the importance of his or her work. Invite guests from your school and community to attend the exhibit. Have students serve as ""roaming curators"" to instruct and interest guests in the Harlem Renaissance and the creative works of these great African-Americans.

Alexander Hleb is presented to the media after completing his loan move to former club Stuttgart.



Hleb had been expected to be part of the swap deal that saw Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Samuel Eto'o switch clubs earlier this week.



But the 28-year-old Belarus international has opted against joining Cameroon striker Eto'o at the San Siro due to the limited prospects of regular football under Jose Mourinho, and instead decided to return to Germany.



Hleb left Stuttgart four years ago to move to English Premier League side Arsenal, where he spent three seasons -- including reaching the Champions League final in 2006, which the Gunners lost to Barcelona.

Hleb eventually ended up moving to the Nou Camp last summer, but struggled to claim a place in the side and was omitted from the 18-man squad that beat Manchester United in this year's Champions League final.



Hleb told Stuttgart's official Web site he had moved to Markus Babbel's side because of their prospects for the coming season.



""I have opted for Stuttgart because the team has great potential and I am convinced that we can achieve a lot together,"" the 28-year-old said.

Alexander Hleb is presented to the media after completing his loan move to former club Stuttgart.



Hleb had been expected to be part of the swap deal that saw Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Samuel Eto'o switch clubs earlier this week.



But the 28-year-old Belarus international has opted against joining Cameroon striker Eto'o at the San Siro due to the limited prospects of regular football under Jose Mourinho, and instead decided to return to Germany.



Hleb left Stuttgart four years ago to move to English Premier League side Arsenal, where he spent three seasons -- including reaching the Champions League final in 2006, which the Gunners lost to Barcelona.

Hleb eventually ended up moving to the Nou Camp last summer, but struggled to claim a place in the side and was omitted from the 18-man squad that beat Manchester United in this year's Champions League final.

The game, though, was marred by a controversial third goal by midfielder Ahmed Hassan which was allowed to stand by referee Jerome Damon despite replays showing the ball had clearly not crossed the line.





By that time the Pharaohs' captain, who was winning a record 170th cap for his country, had already scored an own goal to put the Indomitable Lions ahead after 26 minutes.





Hassan scored again at the other end to pull his side level with a powerful long-range strike before half-time which eventually forced the game into an additional 30 minutes in Benguela.





Substitute Mohamed Gedo then capitalized on an error from Geremi Njitap to put Egypt ahead in extra-time, before Hassan's controversial strike handed them a two-goal cushion.





To make matters worse for Paul Le Guen's Cameroon, Aurelien Chedjou was sent off late on as the north Africans set up a tantalising last-four clash with old foes Algeria.





Cameroon took the lead following a spell of intense pressure. A succession of Achille Emana corners had the Egyptian defence wobbling -- and the seventh one resulted in Hassan's weak-header on the line dropping into his own net.





Cameroon pressed for a second goal but were taken by surprise when Hassan unleashed a fierce 35-yard strike in the 37th minute that deceived goalkeeper Carlos Kameni before finding its way in.





Emad Moteab could have won the game for Egypt right at the death after he was picked out at the back post by a sweeping pass from Hassan, but the Al-Ahly forward could only find the side netting as the game entered extra-time.





However, Hassan Shehata's side wasted no time in killing off the tie going 3-1 up after 95 minutes -- after being gifted both goals.





The first came  when Geremi's poor back-pass from the right was intercepted by Gedo, who and tucked away with ease through the legs of Kameni two minutes after the resumption.





The second seems certain to land South African referee Damon in the spotlight after Hassan's free-kick from the left was pushed onto the underside of the crossbar by the Espanyol goalkeeper and did not cross the line when it hit the ground.





However, it was still allowed to stand much to the dismay of the Cameroon players. It also seemed to knock the stuffing out of Le Guen's men as they failed to create any major openings in the closing 25 minutes.





To add insult to injury, Chedjou was shown a straight red for hauling down last-man Gedo midway through the second period of extra-time with Egypt going on to seal a memorable win.





Meanwhile, Nigeria became the fourth team to reach the semifinals after defeating Zambia in a dull final quarterfinal showdown in Lubango.





Neither side could find the net after 90 minutes and 30 minutes of extra time, but Nigeria progressed 5-4 on penalties and will now face near-neighbors Ghana in the last four on Thursday.





Goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama scored the decisive penalty for Nigeria after Thomas Nyirenda had missed for Zambia.

Substitute Mohamed Gedo then capitalized on an error from Geremi Njitap to put Egypt ahead in extra-time, before Hassan's controversial strike handed them a two-goal cushion.





To make matters worse for Paul Le Guen's Cameroon, Aurelien Chedjou was sent off late on as the north Africans set up a tantalising last-four clash with old foes Algeria.





Cameroon took the lead following a spell of intense pressure. A succession of Achille Emana corners had the Egyptian defence wobbling -- and the seventh one resulted in Hassan's weak-header on the line dropping into his own net.





Cameroon pressed for a second goal but were taken by surprise when Hassan unleashed a fierce 35-yard strike in the 37th minute that deceived goalkeeper Carlos Kameni before finding its way in.





Emad Moteab could have won the game for Egypt right at the death after he was picked out at the back post by a sweeping pass from Hassan, but the Al-Ahly forward could only find the side netting as the game entered extra-time.





However, Hassan Shehata's side wasted no time in killing off the tie going 3-1 up after 95 minutes -- after being gifted both goals.





The first came  when Geremi's poor back-pass from the right was intercepted by Gedo, who and tucked away with ease through the legs of Kameni two minutes after the resumption.





The second seems certain to land South African referee Damon in the spotlight after Hassan's free-kick from the left was pushed onto the underside of the crossbar by the Espanyol goalkeeper and did not cross the line when it hit the ground.





However, it was still allowed to stand much to the dismay of the Cameroon players. It also seemed to knock the stuffing out of Le Guen's men as they failed to create any major openings in the closing 25 minutes.





To add insult to injury, Chedjou was shown a straight red for hauling down last-man Gedo midway through the second period of extra-time with Egypt going on to seal a memorable win.





Meanwhile, Nigeria became the fourth team to reach the semifinals after defeating Zambia in a dull final quarterfinal showdown in Lubango.





Neither side could find the net after 90 minutes and 30 minutes of extra time, but Nigeria progressed 5-4 on penalties and will now face near-neighbors Ghana in the last four on Thursday.

Lisa Pagan was recalled to the Army after being honorably discharged four years ago.



Lisa Pagan, of Davidson, North Carolina, reported for duty Monday morning at Fort Benning, Georgia, with her two preschool children. She had been honorably discharged from active duty at the rank of specialist nearly four years ago but was recalled as part of the Individual Ready Reserve program.



The former Army truck driver asked for a reprieve from deployment because her husband travels for business and they would have no one to care for their children if she was sent overseas. Until Monday, her request had been denied.



Late Monday afternoon, Pagan's lawyer told CNN the Army would grant her request and begin the process of discharge again, this time for good.



""We are definitely heading in the right direction for Lisa and her family and her children,"" said Mark Waple, Pagan's attorney. ""She has been told by her chain of command they plan on doing everything they can within reason to do this as expeditiously as possible.""



Pagan enlisted in 2002 and was honorably discharged from active duty in June 2005. She was never deployed.



Before she left for Fort Benning, Pagan, 27, told CNN affiliate WCNC that her relatives weren't able to care for her children for various reasons, including her relatives' health.



She said her family couldn't afford having her husband give up his job. They would lose their house, she told the Charlotte, North Carolina-TV station.



""I'm a human being. I need to take care of my children. They don't have anybody else,"" Pagan told WCNC.



Since September 11, 2001, the Army has recalled about 25,000 soldiers. Nearly half requested a delay or a full exemption. Some just wanted to finish their school semester before reporting. Others had financial or medical problems that made it difficult to report for duty.
